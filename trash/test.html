Turning to the first factor, the Court next addressed the purpose and character of the use.Drawing on the rule articulated nearly three decades earlier in Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.,the majority considered whether Google’s use imbued the copied code “with new expression, meaning or message,”or, more simply, whether it was “transformative.”Justice Breyer noted that the purpose of “virtually any unauthorized use of a copyrighted computer program” will necessarily be functional in service of “accomplish[ing] particular tasks,” just as Google’s was.Ending the inquiry there would thus “severely limit the scope of fair use” for software.As such, he asserted: “[W]e must go further.”To that end, the Court looked to Google’s creation of the entire Android platform, in which it “reimplemented” the API, and all the new products and programming opportunities that Android created in turn.Even allowing that Google’s use was “commercial in nature,” the majority found in favor of fair use on this factor.
